### Read

- [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

wikipedia says that WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

- [Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed. Socket.IO is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js. It is one of the most depended upon library on npm (Node Package Manager).

- [Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

  - Explains the difference betwen WebSocket and Socket.io
    - WebSocket is the communication Protocol that  provides biderectional communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection.
      - Remains open all the time to allow real-time data transfer
    - Socket.io is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between Client and the Web servers.
