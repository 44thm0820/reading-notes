Attending the CMU Startup Meetup https://lu.ma/x8ljqsnb (Links to an external site.) at 2pm in San Francisco at a rooftop of a hotel across the street  from SF Giant's Oracle Park. CMU stands for Carnegie Mellon University.  I have not attended this school, but it looks like it's open to non-alumni. I have a friend who attended grad school at CMU and maybe I might establish a connection or two by mentioning his name.
