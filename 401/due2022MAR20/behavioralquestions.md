## Describe A Difficult Work Situation And What You Did To Overcome It

### Situation 
  - I was tasked for a month long temporary project to be a supervisor for workers who had supervisors below me supervising locations around the country - one supervisor below me was refusing to perform basic duties as many different reports from many different people

  - Task - evaluate the situation, and make the correct decision
  - Action - i traveled to the work location where the supervisor was working, and sat down with him to understand why he was not performing basic duties. He let me know that his regular supervisor advised him to not perform the duties of the role so he could be sent back to help his organization he had just come from. I advised the supervisor he has a duty to perform as tasked by someone with higher ranking than his normal supervisor, and warned him if he did not continue to perform he would be replaced.  I sent a copy to both him and his regular supervisor.  A few days later, I continued to receive the same reports about him. He seemed to remain loyal to his usual supervisor.  I asked my supervisor to review my plan to replace him immediately.  My supervisor agreed, and we had a more cooperative replacement after the former supervisor was dismissed for not performing. My supervisor said he would be sending an account to his boss's boss, revealing that the refusal to perform did not only come from one person but his supervisor who influenced the subordinate to behave poorly.
  - Result - a more normalized performer of a supervisor.

- Result-  You will see that I provide a compelling case why I should be considered most for filling this role

## What Is Your Greatest Accomplishment?

- Situation-the general of the division wants to visit a nuclear reactor on the other side of the country - but does not have the resources alone to do it - need me and my team to make it happen
- Task - coordinate with internal employees and external employees and see through the project's feasibility and execution if feasible
- Action - make a plan and refine it with the team, and efficiently and actively communicate with the necessary people needed to be involved whether they be within the organization or far from it.
- Result- success, through careful planning and research, as well as execution, as one of the leads we were able to achieve a great success for the general's request.  it reminded me that success can be achieved beyond one's previous limits by belief and effort.
