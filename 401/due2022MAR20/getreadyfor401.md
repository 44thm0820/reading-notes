- [x] [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

The author John Sonmez recommends to the reader a six-step process that can be used for any algorithm type programming solution, with the added caveat that one should spend 70% of one's time in the first 3 steps.  The steps are listed as follows:

1. Read the problem completely twice.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
3. Optimize the manual steps.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
6. Optimize the real code.

The fact that Code Fellows requires all 401 students to read this article written in 2011 demonstrates how valuable this particular strategy still is today in the job of coding or in whiteboard interviews.

First of all, I found the link listed in the assignment to be dead.  medium.com says the author deleted the article.  However, with a little googling, I was able to find the article archived before it was deleted on archive.org. The active link is https://web.archive.org/web/20201018073012/https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d.

The article points out to the reader that being productive is not as a result of just being busy but being focused.  One should not be busy or stressed, but focused, in order to be successful. 

Also, it is important one educates others that your time is expensive, important, and valuable, in order to change their behavior on how they should value the time spent with you. In other words, treat your time as a valuable commodity, so that others will also treat your time in the same manner.

The article also states that "really successful people say no to most things, because most things won't get them to where they truly want to be."

The article concludes by saying that if you value your time at what it deserves to be, you'll complete more important and productive work (and do less trivial and mindless tasks).
