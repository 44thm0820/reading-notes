## Reading

[Socket.io Chat Example](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

This is about 11 page reading when printed out.  This is an article in the Socket.io doc that serves to introduce a developer to Socket.IO by writing a simple chat application step by step using Socket.IO.

It probably this required reading is not meant for just reading, but also to code along to understand socket.io concepts as they are explained as the chat app is built.


[Rooms and Namespaces](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms/)

This is another document from socket.io docs which serves to show how a room (an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave, but also a channel that can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.) is used and is important in  socket.io.

[Socket.io Emit Cheatsheet](https://socket.io/docs/v4/emit-cheatsheet/)

Lastly of the three readings here is a third doc from socket.io that shows how you can emit on the server side and the client of socket.io.  Last section mentions all the reserved words not to be used in socket.io.
