### 5 steps to RBAC

[5 steps to RBAC - CSO](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3060780/5-steps-to-simple-role-based-access-control.html)

RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.

RBAC definition: 

- RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role within an organization. The system needs of a given workforce are analyzed, with users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs. Access is then assigned to each person based strictly on their role assignment. With tight adherence to access requirements established for each role, access management becomes much easier.

RBAC VS ABAC VS ACL

Access control lists (ACL) — An ACL is a means of defining access rights by a given user or user group, to a specific object, such as a document.  As a simple example, an ACL could be used to allow users from one department to make changes to a document, while only allowing users from other departments to read the document.

Attribute-based access control (ABAC) — ABAC, sometimes known as policy-based access control, can use a variety of attributes, including user department, time of day, location of access, type of access required, etc. to determine whether a user’s access request should be granted.

#### RBAC Implementation in 5 steps

1. Inventory your systems - take stock of capabilities to have RBAC
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles - define only a few categories of roles
3. Assign people to roles - assign according to job description
4. Never make one-off changes - be consistent in applying the rules
5. Audit -periodically

### wiki - RBAC

[wiki - RBAC - wikpedia](https://jwt.io/introduction/)

Role-based access control (RBAC) or role-based security, is:
  - an approach in computer systems security, to restricting system access to authorized users.
  - an approach to implement mandatory access control or discretionary access control.
  - a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.

The components of RBAC: role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships simplify performing user assignments.
