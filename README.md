### My reading notes

    insert code block here - more than three space indent

  now you can also add inline code formatting ``console.log('hello')``

  here you can type normal paragraph text.

###### Indenting paragraphs cant be done in markdown

    The quick brown fox jumped

over the lazy dog. Now is the time

for all good men to serve their

country. Note that more than three leading spaces creates a codeblock 

automatically.

  Lorem ipsum whatever and then
what...

  Refer to https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-192 
for reference on how indentation is ignored in a paragraph in 
markdown.
