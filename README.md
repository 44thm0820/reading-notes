### My reading notes

#### Indenting paragraphs cant be done in markdown

    The quick brown fox jumped
over the lazy dog. Now is the time
for all good men to serve their
country. Note that more than three leading spaces creates a codeblock 
automatically.

  Lorem ipsum whatever and then
what...

  Refer to https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-192 
for reference on how indentation is ignored in a paragraph in 
markdown.

#### My codeblock using tildes

~~~
a
b
c
~~~

#### My alternate codeblock using backticks

``` javascript
  console.log('Hello world');
```
