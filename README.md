### My reading notes

    insert code block here - more than three space indent

  now you can also add inline code formatting ``console.log('hello')``

  here you can type normal paragraph text.

###### Indenting paragraphs cant be done in markdown

    The quick brown fox jumped

over the lazy dog. Now is the time

for all good men to serve their

country. Note that more than three leading spaces creates a codeblock 

automatically.

  Lorem ipsum whatever and then
what...

  Refer to https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-192 
for reference on how indentation is ignored in a paragraph in 
markdown.

Reading
Component-Based Architecture (Links to an external site.)

What is a “component”? Per https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm, (Links to an external site.) a component can be defined three ways:
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

 

A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is, a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

A component can have three different views − object-oriented view, conventional view, and process-related view.
What are the characteristics of a component? There are six listed characteristics of components - reusability, replaceable, not context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent: 
Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

What are the advantages of using component-based architecture? There are eight listed advantages of using component-based architecture - ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, and independent. 
Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different group in parallel. Productivity for the software development and future software development.

What is Props and How to Use it in React (Links to an external site.)

What is “props” short for? Per the article https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0, (Links to an external site.) props is short for properties.  "props" is a special keyword in React and is used to code in React to pass data from one component to another, specifically, downward one-way data flow.
How are props used in React? There are three steps to use props in React as specified in the article https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0 (Links to an external site.) . 
Firstly, define an attribute and its value(data)
Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
Finally, render the Props Data
What is the flow of props? Uni-directionally from parent to child is the flow of props. Note that the props data is read-only such that the child component cannot change props that it receives from the parent.
To recap per the article:
Props stand for properties and is a special keyword in React
Props are being passed to components like function arguments
Props can only be passed to components in one way (parent to child)
Props data is immutable (read-only)

Reading
React lifecycle (Links to an external site.)
Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
Render happens before the componentDidMount as the diagram seems to illustrate.



What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
constructor() (Links to an external site.) is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React.
The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted.If the component is a subclass you should call super(props), or the props will be undefined. constructors can be used to assign state using this.state or to bind event handle methods to an instance.

class FishTableRow extends React.Component {

constructor() {

super(props); //gives us access to props

//Don’t call this.setState() here

this.state = { //intitialize local state

showDescription: false

}; }

Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
 

constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount

 

What does componentDidMount do?
It is a function that returns a boolean that indicates whether a React component was successfully mounted.

It is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.

This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

You may call setState() immediately in componentDidMount(). It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render() will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor() instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position.

React State Vs Props (Links to an external site.)


What types of things can you pass in the props? data that you dont expect to change (vs state where you do expect data to change) 
What is the big difference between props and state? state is handled in the component while props are handled outside the component and must be updated outside of the component. when you change state, you automatically re-render the app.
When do we re-render our application? when we change state
What are some examples of things that we could store in state? things that you expect to change in the app are things we could store in state.  data that comes from a form when it is submitted by the user is one example.  toggling button is another use for state

What does .map() return?
A new array with each element being the result of the callback function. (per https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map#return_value (Links to an external site.))

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX (Links to an external site.) using curly braces {} (per https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#rendering-multiple-components (Links to an external site.))

Each list item needs a unique ____.
key in React.

What is the purpose of a key?
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. (per https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html#basic-list-component (Links to an external site.))

React docs say 

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>    {number}
  </li>
);
The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:

const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs  <li key={index}>    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. 

What is the spread operator?
InJavaScript, spread syntax (Links to an external site.) refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

“When ...arr is used in the function call, it ‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments.” — JavaScript.info (Links to an external site.)

The spread operator was added to JavaScript in ES6 (ES2015), just like the rest parameters (Links to an external site.), which have the same syntax: three magic dots ….

The spread syntax “spreads” the array into separate arguments.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
Copying an array
Concatenating or combining arrays
Using Math functions
Using an array as arguments
Adding an item to a list
Adding to state in React
Combining objects
Converting NodeList to an array
In each case, the spread syntax expands an iterable object, usually an array, though it can be used on any iterable, including a string.

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍
Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]
Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
he creates a function inside App called increment where he means to pass it down to a child component Person

In your own words, what does the increment function do?
uses setState to set a value of the key value pair count that is one more than its previous value, if the string being passed in is equal to a key value pair of name in one of the objects in the array of people in state.

How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
pass as a prop like <Person increment={this.increment} /> in the component that contains the state (App to its child Person)  

How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
if one component needs to update the state of another then it needs to have the function from the first component.

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
The form is an example of a controlled component in React.

An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.  It is controlled because React state maintains the state that previously HTML would control in form elements.  In other words the React state, for the form, could be called the single source of truth, as React when maintaining a form only needs to rely upon React for the mutable data in the form, and not HTML, such that the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. 

The controlled component solves the issue when the form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The 

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
That's a good problem to have.  Either one, depending on your needs for the form.  What is cool is that you are not limited to one choice when you use React to have a form.
Also, because it can be tedious to used controlled components, uncontrolled components would be a more optimal solution in order to avoid the tedium. Refer to https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#alternatives-to-controlled-components (Links to an external site.) for more info.
 
How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field? We can have a state that records what the user is entering before he or she submits.
The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained (Links to an external site.)

Why would we use a ternary operator? for brevity instead of using the if then else statement
Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)

Reading
React Docs - Thinking in ReactLinks to an external site.

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?   
It is a technique to decide what should be its own component.  This technique is a computer-programming principle that states that every module class or function in a computer should have responsibiliy over a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate that part.  It is the S in the SOLID principles acronym for five design principles intended to make software design more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
A version of a react app that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity is called a static version of your app.

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
Interactivity

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?  
Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
How can you identify where state needs to live?
For each piece of state in your application:

Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
Higher-Order FunctionsLinks to an external site.

What is a “higher-order function”? Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. 
Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing? Returning a function

per today's students' questions regarding what line 2 is function doing:

line2 is returning another function.  

moreover, greaterThan creates a closure with line 2.

greaterThan is by definition a higher order function, because it returns a function.

subsequent lines after line 2 show how greaterThan was used when invoked and assigned to another function greaterThan10.

I think the correct answer to question 2 here then would be just to say greaterThan returns a function, which then shows that greaterThan is an example of a higher order function.  I think that was the point of the question, to answer that we recognize that greaterThan function returns a function.

Below you will find some reading material, code samples, and some additional resources that support today’s topic and the upcoming lecture.

Review the Submission Instructions for guidance on completing and submitting this assignment.

 (Links to an external site.)Reading
First Reading on Node.js on sitepoint (Links to an external site.)

 (Links to an external site.)1. What is node.js?
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime. It's a program we use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

 (Links to an external site.)2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine is a performance-centric program that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, that compiles JavaScript so that our computers can use JS.

 (Links to an external site.)3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
node allows the execution of JavaScript on our computer rather than just the browser.

 (Links to an external site.)4. What is npm?
npm is the JavaScript Package Manager as well as the world's largest software registry.

 (Links to an external site.)5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
typing node -v, I got v16.14.0

 (Links to an external site.)6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
typing npm -v, I got 8.3.1

 (Links to an external site.)7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install -g jshint

 (Links to an external site.)8. What is node used for?
 (Links to an external site.)One use of Node is installing via npm and running via Node various build tools designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application
 (Links to an external site.)Webpack, ESLint, Gulp.js, Mocha, and Chai are common build tools found by using node
 (Links to an external site.)Node also allows server-side programs to be written in JavaScript. It can be used as a scripting language. It is suited to building applications that require real-time interaction or collaboraration like chat sites
 (Links to an external site.)Node is single-threaded but also event-driven. If node encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request
 (Links to an external site.)Thusly, Node has asynchronous (non-blocking behavior)
 (Links to an external site.)Node's execution model causes the server very little overhead, compared to traditional servers such as Apache, PHP, or Ruby, which block execution of subsequent I/O operations until the current operation completes
Second reading on codefellows.org (Links to an external site.)

 (Links to an external site.)1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
Greater Efficiency - research shows higher-quality code for a slightly longer duration
Engaged collaboration - augments engagement for both programmers
Learning from fellow students - forces teaching or learning for communication for both
Social skills - improves interpersonal skills, qualities employers look for
Job interview readiness -skills improved in pair programming are what employers interviewi for
Work environment readiness - skills on day-to-day work pairing puts someone more qualified than a cs grad with no prior experience pairing
 (Links to an external site.)2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I don't have much experience in the industry, but have pair programmed before... I'd say though work environment readiness... it saves costs for employers when not much investment needed to train someone who has experience collaborating in programming.

 (Links to an external site.)3. How does pair programming work?
One is designated the driver, and the other is designated the navigator. The driver is the programmer who types, including controlling the text editor, switching files, version control and what gets written. The navigator vocalizes guidance to the driver but does not provide direct input to the computer. The navigator is expected to focus on the big picture, anticpating what comes next, how algorithm may be converted to code, while reviewing driver's code for typos or bugs. The navigator uses the time not typing to also research documentation, and solutions on a browser.

How I explained REST to my brotherLinks to an external site.
Who is Roy Fielding?
Roy Fielding helped write the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. He researched and explained why web works the way it does. His name is on the spec for the protocol that is used to get the pages from servers to your browser, called HTTP.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
We now don't have a need to talk to all the machines in the world to get what we want from any of them. We just need to talk to a small group of machines now.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
Fielding helped create REST, an HTTP protocol that is an acronym for Representational State Transfer.

What does a GET do? 
GET: Retrieve info on HTTP

What does a POST do? 
POST: add info on HTTP

What does PUT do? 
PUT: replace on HTTP

What does PATCH do? 
PATCH: partial update on HTTP

What does REST stand for? Representational State Transfer
REST APIs are designed around a ____. resources, which are any kind of any object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.
What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example. URI, an identifier, is what a resource has to allow the resource to be uniquely identified. An example of a URI is https://adventure-works.com/orders/1 (Links to an external site.) 
What are the most common HTTP verbs? GET, POST , PUT, PATCH, AND DELETE 
What should the URIs be based on? nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource). A bad URI would be https://adventure-works.com/create-order because it is based on the verb (the operations on the resource) instead of the resource (noun).
Give an example of a good URI. https://adventure-works.com/orders

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
To have a chatty web API means to have a large number of I/O requests. It's a bad thing as the cumulative effect of this large number of requests can have a significant impact on performance. Instead consider packaging the data into larger and thus fewer requests. Another consideration would be to fetch data from a database as one query, instead of several smaller queries.

What status code does a successful GET request return? A successful GET request returns a HTTP status code 200 (OK)
What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return? An unsuccessful GET request returns a HTTP status code 404 (NOT FOUND)
What status code does a successful POST request return? A successful POST request returns a HTTP status code 201 (CREATED)
If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created). The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response. The response body contains a representation of the resource.

If the method does some processing but does not create a new resource, the method can return HTTP status code 200 and include the result of the operation in the response body. Alternatively, if there is no result to return, the method can return HTTP status code 204 (No Content) with no response body.

If the client puts invalid data into the request, the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request). The response body can contain additional information about the error or a link to a URI that provides more details.

What status code does a successful DELETE request return? A successful DELETE request returns with HTTP status code 204 (No Content), indicating that the process was successfully handled, but that the response body contains no further information. If the resource does not exist, the web server can return HTTP 404(NOT FOUND).

What is functional programming? A programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of math functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. Different from object-oriented programming

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function? Pure functions give the same output every time. two signs it is a pure function: 1) returns the same result given the same arguments; this concept is also known as deterministic 2) does not cause observable side effects

What are the benefits of a pure function? Predictability and easier to test.

What is immutability? unchanging over time in respect to data.

What is Referential transparency? if a function consistently yields the same result for the

same input, it is referentially transparent.  this characteristic of referential transparency also comes as a result of a pure function having immutable data.

What is a module? another javascript file.
What does the word ‘require’ do? look into another file to use a data structure not in your
current file, offers modularity aka organization
How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in? use the keyword 'require' with the filename the file resides and the variable or other data structure you need.
What do we have to do to make a module available? have the line module.exports = the data structure you want made available.  in the youtube video, the function counter is made available from the file count.js by having a line in the bottom of the code in count.js saying module.exports = counter;  This process is similar to what we have being doing in react, where we add the line export default <name of class component> to the bottom of the file that declares the class component.  For example Main.js file has the class component Main declared and defined, and the last line is written as export default Main; which allows this Main class component module to be made available by another file.  App.js which uses the Main class component, makes Main's class component declaration available to App.js by writing import Main from './Main.js' in the beginning of the file of App.js.

nosql vs sql (Links to an external site.)
Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	NoSQL
 Relational Databases	Non-relational or distributed database 
 table-based, adheres to schema definitions	 document-base, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores - do not have standard schema definitions which NoSQL needs to adhere to
 has predefined schema	has dynamic schema for unstructured data 
 vertically scalable	horizontally scalable 
uses SQL	queries are focused on collection of documents, also known as Unstructured Query Languag
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Heavy duty transactional type applications.
Give a real world example. Keeping track of bank transactions.
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? hierarchical data storage
Give a real world example. keeping data in JSON which is hierarchical data, is good fit for NosQL
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? NoSQL
Which type of database is best for scalability? SQL is best for vertical scalability, by adding CPU RAM or SSD on a single server to manage increasing load. NoSQL is best for horizontal scalability (for example adding a few more servers to your NoSQL to handle larger traffic).

Reading
Status Codes Based On REST Methods (Links to an external site.)
In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = informational status codes, tells client that the request's header has been received, and the server tells the client will try to comply with a transmission demand coming from the client
200’s = success codes, tells client that the client's request was accepted by the server, passing all validation requirements. in the case of an asynchronous nature of a request by the client, 202, the success code does not mean the request was successfully processed, but only the server tells the client that the request met all validation requirements at the time the request was sent.
300’s = redirection codes, where server tells the client that the resource that the client request is not available at the location that the client expected.  Reasons can be multiple why, temporary, permanent.  The result of the client receiving a 300 code from the server means that the client will need to send a new request to a new location.
400’s = client error codes, representing invalid requests that the client sent to the server.  causes of this error include timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication and so on. In other words the server sends a 400 code to the client because the client sent incorrect input.  Remedy then would be to have the client confirm the correct input parameters, before the client attempt another request. 
500’s = server error codes, often cause is the server is overwhelmed, or the server is unreachable behind proxies.  500 server error code could also be the result to an incorrect client request that trigger error exceptions from the server. Error maybe either temporary or permanent. Remedy often is for the client to retry the same request.
What is a status code 202? 202 is accepted that is returned as a result of asynchronous processing request, a CREATE or aka POST. It is an intermediate status code while further processing determines the async request went well
What is a status code 308? Permanent direct -data requested will be available at a new URL and server sends this URL to client to access (API Change).
What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client? 404 if its the client's fault. a 500s code if it was the server's fault
What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does? 300 series
What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding (Links to an external site.)

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science? personal computers became important and commonplace.
Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up? computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had been grown up playing with computers at home, which were true for mostly male students
Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies (Links to an external site.)

What is OAuth (Links to an external site.)

What is OAuth? open standard authorization protocol or framework that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access to their assets without actually sharing the initial related single logon credential.
Give an example of what using OAuth would look like. Being offered to log on a website that isnt google using your google account.
How does OAuth work?
The first website connects to the second website on behalf of the user, using OAuth, providing the user’s verified identity.

The second site generates a one-time token and a one-time secret unique to the transaction and parties involved.

The first site gives this token and secret to the initiating user’s client software.

The client’s software presents the request token and secret to their authorization provider (which may or may not be the second site).

If not already authenticated to the authorization provider, the client may be asked to authenticate. After authentication, the client is asked to approve the authorization transaction to the second website.

The user approves (or their software silently approves) a particular transaction type at the first website.

The user is given an approved access token (notice it’s no longer a request token).

The user gives the approved access token to the first website.

The first website gives the access token to the second website as proof of authentication on behalf of the user.

The second website lets the first website access their site on behalf of the user.

The user sees a successfully completed transaction occurring.

OAuth is not the first authentication/authorization system to work this way on behalf of the end-user. In fact, many authentication systems, notably Kerberos, work similarly. What is special about OAuth is its ability to work across the web and its wide adoption. It succeeded with adoption rates where previous attempts failed (for various reasons).

What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user? it's a temporary key that has an expiration date, like a hotel room key
What is OpenID? not the same as oauth
